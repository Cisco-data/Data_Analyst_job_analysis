I was conducting some analysis on data analyst jobs to get a better understanding of these roles. I looked at the salary, job growth, whether they are remote positions, if you need any type of schooling or not, and the tech they used for that specific position. I searched 20 different job postings on Indeed and then I inserted the data into an excel spreadsheet. After that was concluded I used PostgreSQL to create a database for the data gathered. Once everything was created, I used 3 different queries to answer these 3 questions.

-How many data analyst jobs are in Orlando, Florida that have salaries of $50,000 or more a -year?

-How many data analyst positions require a bachelorâ€™s degree?

-What is the job growth for data analysts in the United States?
